	* Added try-error handler for loglikCopula and loglikMvdc.
	This will allow the optimizer to keep searching when NaN is returned.

	* Changed the way to generate function calls to evaluate 
	[dpqr]<distrib> for each margin, thank to 
	Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>.
	The package can interact now with package nor1mix.

	* Fixed random number generator of amhCopula.
	The formula in Johnson (1988) has undefined quantities.

	* Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern class implemented with
	distribution, density and random number generation. 
	Class needs to be properly tested, especially random 
	number generation.

	* Merged with package copulab by Ivan Kojadinovic 
	<ivan.kojadinovic@.univ-nantes.fr>, who
	provides the multivariate independence test of 
	Genest and Rémillard (2004).

	* Association measures are exported into the namespace:
	kendallsTau, spearmansRho, and tailIndex. Calibration
	functions are implemented for Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho. 

	* Extreme value copula class is implemented. This class 
	includes Galambos, Husler-Reiss.

	* Added Archimedean copula Ali-Mikhail-Haq.

	* Added Plackett copula.

	* The three Archemedean copulas (clayton, frank, and gumbel) now
	have their density expressions imported from mathematica, after 
	some symbolic simplification, which helps to eliminate some numerical
	precisions problems on the boundary of the unit square. 

	Frank copula has the most complicated expressions. On 4GB memory
	machine it ran out of memory for dim = 10. So for frank copula, the
	maximum dimension implemented is dim = 6.	
	
	The symbolic expressions are processed in R with function deriv
	to generate efficient algorithmic expressions.
