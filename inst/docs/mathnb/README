archmCPdf.m: Mathematica code that generates expressions of Archimedean copula
             cdf, pdf, and genfun derivatives; the maximum dimension for Frank
             is determined to be 4, otherwise, the system run out of memory.
             In particular, derPdfWrtPar is the toughest one to get.

evcopula.nb: Mathematica notebook that generates expressions of extreme value
             copula cdf, pdf, and deriv1cdf

exprPrep.R: R code that reads the expression files and generate R objects
            into ../../R/.

getDerExpr.m: Abandoned Mathematica code that generates derivative expressions.
              Reason of abandoning: after reading pdf expressions back in,
              they are not exactly the same as before. Why?
